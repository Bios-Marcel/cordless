	vim-mode - minor vim mode for cordless

[::b]SYNOPSIS
	[::b]Normal Mode: Navigate around the containers with hjkl.
	Perform some usual commands inside text box input, as pasting, moving cursor or such.
	Press ESC anywhere to return to normal mode.

	[::b]Insert Mode: Type inside box input, perform actions inside chatview.
	Insert without any key restriction inside the text box using insert mode.
	Inside chat view, perform useful commands such as editing message "i" or replying to user "a"

	[::b]Visual Mode: Move around everywhere with vim keys.
	This mode allows to use hjkl pretty much anywhere inside the app. Due to some restrictions, this is
	the only mode that officially supports using hjkl anywhere.
	Also allows using same commands as insert mode inside chat view, or selecting text inside text input.


[::b]DESCRIPTION
	This is a minor mode for vim. See all the shorcuts with Ctrl K, and edit them inside shortcuts/shortcuts.go
	Toggle vim with vim on/off/enable/disable
