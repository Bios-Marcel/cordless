const chatViewDocumentation = `[::b]TOPIC
	chatview - component that displays the messages in a channel

[::b]DESCRIPTION
	The chatview is the component that displays the messages of the channel
	that you are currently looking at.

	The chatview has two modes. The navigation mode is active when the
	chatview does not have focus. While in navigation mode you can't select
	any message, but you can scroll through the messages using Ctrl+ArrowUp/ArrowDown
	or your mousewheel. If you focus the chatview, it enters the selection
	mode, allowing you to select single messages and interact with those.

	When in selection mode, those shortcuts are active:

	--------------------------------------------
	|            Action           |  Shortcut  |
	| --------------------------- | ---------- |
	| Edit message                | e          |
	| Delete message              | Delete     |
	| Copy content                | c          |
	| Copy link to message        | l          |
	| Reply with mention          | r          |
	| Quote message               | q          |
	| Hide / show spoiler content | s          |
	| Selection up                | ArrowUp    |
	| Selection down              | ArrowDown  |
	| Selection to top            | Home       |
	| Selection to bottom         | End        |
	--------------------------------------------

	Keep in mind, that those shortcuts might differ from your settings, as
	those are just the defaults.`

const commandsDocumentation = `[::b]TOPIC
	commands - commands allow you to execute certain actions within cordless

[::b]DESCRIPTION
	Commands can only be entered via the command-input component.
	Commands can't be called from outside the application or on startup.

	All commands follow a certain semantics pattern:
		COMMAND SUBCOMMAND --SETTING "Some setting value" MAIN_VALUE

	Not every command makes use of all of the possible combinations. Each
	command may have zero or more subcommands and zero or more settings.
	There may also be settings that do not require you passing a value.
	If a value contains spaces it needs to be quoted beforehand, otherwise
	the input will be separated at each given space. Some commands require
	some main value, which is basically the non-optional input for that
	command. That value doesn't require a setting-name to be prepended in
	front of it.

	After typing a command, it will be added to your history. The history
	doesn't persist between cordless sessions, it will be forgotten every
	time you close the application. The history can be travelled through
	by using the arrow up and down keys. An exception for historization
	are secret inputs like passwords, those aren't directly typed into the
	command-input. Instead cordless shows an extra dialog as soon as it
	requires you to input sensitive information like passwords.

	Since the command-input component uses the same underlying component
	as the message-input, you can use the same shortcuts for editing
	your input.

	Available commands:
%s
[::b]EXAMPLES
	[gray]$ user-set -n "Marcel Schramm" -a /home/pics/avatar.png

	[gray]$ status set online
	[gray]$ status get`
const configurationDocumentation = `[::b]TOPIC
	configuration - allows you to change settings and persist them between
	sessions

[::b]DESCRIPTION
	Currently all almost configuration is done via manually editing the
	configuration file. There are however some settings like the fix-layout
	setting and the chatheader setting that can be set via the commands
	feature.

	At some point there will be a user-interface for changing settings and
	commands will be removed.

	The configuration file can be found somewhere in the user directory.
	The precise location differs from platform to platform. Whenever you
	start cordless, it will display the location of your configuration file
	in the splashscreen.

	Typical location on Linux:   [::b]~/.config/cordless/config.json[::-].
	Typical location on Windows: [::b]~/AppData/Roaming/cordless/config.json[::-].
	Typical location on MacOS:   [::b]~/.cordless/config.json[::-].

		command.`

const messageEditorDocumentation = `[::b]TOPIC
	message-editor - the component that allows you to input text for a message.

[::b]DESCRIPTION
	The editor is a custom written widget and builds on top of the

	the complete selection behaviour. This widget isn't fully implemented yet
	and still has some flaws.

	By default, it offers the following shortcuts:
