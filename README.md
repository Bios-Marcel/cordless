Cordless is supposed to be a custom [Discord](https://discordapp.com) client
that aims to have a low memory footprint and be aimed at power-users.

**WARNING: Self-bots are discouraged and against Discords TOS.**

This project was mainly inspired by [Southclaws](https://github.com/Southclaws)
[Cordless](https://github.com/Southclaws/cordless-old), which he sadly didn't
develop any further.

The application only uses the official Discord API and doesn't send data to
any third party. However, this application is not a official product
by Discord Inc.

Big thanks to [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=cordless) for providing the
cordless project with free licenses!

## How to install it

### Installing on Linux

#### Snap

On linux the recommended way of installation is the snap.

Simply run (Might require sudo):

```shell
snap install cordless
```

Snap will automatically install updates.

#### Arch based Linux distributions

On Arch based distributions, you can use the AUR package to install cordless:

##### Manually:

```shell
$ git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/cordless-git.git
$ cd cordless-git
$ makepkg -sric
```

##### With AUR Helpers:

###### yay:
```shell
$ yay -Syu cordless-git
```
or
```shell
$ yay -S cordless-git
```
###### trizen:
```shell
$ trizen -S cordless-git
```

###### pacaur
```shell
$ pacuar -S cordless-git
```

#### Manual Linux installation

[Building it from source](#building-it-from-source) (note: requires xclip in order to be able to copy and paste properly.
 There is currently no wayland support for copy and paste.)

### Installing on Windows

In order to install the latest version on Windows, you first need
[scoop](https://scoop.sh/#installs-in-seconds).

After installing scoop, run the following:

```ps1
scoop bucket add biosmarcel https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/scoopbucket.git
```

This adds the bucket (repository) to your local index, allowing you to
install any package from that bucket.

Install cordless via

```ps1
scoop install cordless
```

In order to install updates, run:

```ps1
scoop update cordless
```

### Installing on macOS

Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install `cordless` on macOS:

```shell
brew tap Bios-Marcel/cordless
brew install cordless
```

If you don't install via homebrew, then you should get `pngpaste`, since it's
what allows you to paste images.

### Building it from source

In order to execute this command
[you need to have go 1.12 or a more recent version installed](https://golang.org/doc/install).

**UPDATES HAVE TO BE INSTALLED MANUALLY**

First you have to grab the code via:

```shell
go get -u github.com/Bios-Marcel/cordless
```

In order to execute the application, simply run the executable, which lies at
`$GOPATH/bin/cordless`. In order to be able to run this from your terminal,
`$GOPATH/bin` has to be in your `PATH` variable.

### Login

Logging in works via the UI on first startup of the application.

If you are logging in with a bot token, you have to prepend `Bot ` (yes, with
the space) in front of the token. Pasting only works via your terminals normal pasting shortcut.

**THIS APPLICATION NEVER SAVES YOUR ACTUAL PASSWORD LOCALLY.**

If you need to find out how to retrieve your token, [check the wiki at](https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/cordless/wiki/Retrieving-your-token).

## Quick overview - Navigation (switching between boxes / containers)

| Shortcut | Action |
| - |:- |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> | Sets the focus on the servers (guilds) container |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> | Sets the focus on the channels container |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> | Sets the focus on the messages container |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> | Sets the focus on the messages input field |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> | Sets the focus on the users container |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> | Opens the direct messages container |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> | Toggles the internal console view |

Further shortcuts / key-bindings can be found in the manual on the internal
console with the command `manual`.

If any of the default commands don't work for you, open the keyboard shortcut
changer via <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>.

## Contributing

All kinds of contributions are welcome. Whether it's correcting typos, fixing
bugs, adding features or whatever else might be good for the project. If you
want to contribute code, please create a new branch and commit only changes
relevant to your planned pull request onto that branch. This will help
isolating new changes and make merging those into `master` easier.

If you encounter any issues, whether it's bugs or the lack of certain features,
don't hesitate to create a new GitHub issue.

If there are specific issues you want to be solved quickly, you can set a
bounty on those via [IssueHunt](https://issuehunt.io/r/Bios-Marcel/cordless).
The full 100% of the bounty goes to whoever solves the issue, no matter
whether that's me or someone else.

If none of those ways of contributing are your kind of thing, feel free to
donate something via [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/biosmarcel/donate).
It may not directly have an impact on the project, but it will surely motivate
me to keep working on this project, as it shows that people care about it.
