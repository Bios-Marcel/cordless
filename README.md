**WARNING: Third party clients are discouraged and against the Discord TOS.**

Cordless is supposed to be a custom [Discord](https://discordapp.com) client
that aims to have a low memory footprint and be aimed at power-users.

The application only uses the official Discord API and doesn't send data to
any third party. However, this application is not a official product
by Discord Inc.

## Installation

### Installing on Linux

#### Snap

On linux the recommended way of installation is the snap.

Simply run (Might require sudo):

```shell
snap install cordless
```

Snap will automatically install updates.

#### Arch based Linux distributions

On Arch based distributions, you can use the AUR package to install cordless:

##### Manually:

```shell
$ git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/cordless-git.git
$ cd cordless-git
$ makepkg -sric
```

##### With AUR Helpers:

###### yay:

```shell
$ yay -Syu cordless-git
```
or
```shell
$ yay -S cordless-git
```

###### trizen:

```shell
$ trizen -S cordless-git
```

###### pacaur

```shell
$ pacaur -S cordless-git
```

### Installing on Windows

In order to install the latest version on Windows, you first need to install
[scoop](https://scoop.sh/#installs-in-seconds).

After installing scoop, run the following:

This adds the bucket (repository) that contains cordless to your local scoop
installation, allowing you to install any package it contains. Afterwards
it installs cordless for your current windows user.

```ps1
scoop bucket add biosmarcel https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/scoopbucket.git
scoop install cordless
```

Updates can be installed via:

```ps1
scoop update cordless
```

### Installing on macOS

Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install `cordless` on macOS:

```shell
brew tap Bios-Marcel/cordless
brew install cordless
```

If you don't install via cordless via brew, then you should have to get
`pngpaste` in order to be able to paste image data.

### Building from source

In order to execute the following commands
[you need to have go 1.12 or a more recent version installed](https://golang.org/doc/install).

**UPDATES HAVE TO BE INSTALLED MANUALLY**

You can either install the binary into your `$GOPATH/bin` by running:

```shell
go get -u github.com/Bios-Marcel/cordless
```

Which you can then execute by running the executable, which lies at
`$GOPATH/bin/cordless`. In order to be able to run this from your terminal,
`$GOPATH/bin` has to be in your `PATH` variable. The very same command can
be used for updating.

or you manually grab the source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/cordless
cd cordless
go build .
```

If done this way, updates have to be installed via:

```shell
cd cordless
git pull
go build .
```

Note:
* X11 users need `xclip` in order to copy and paste.
* Wayland users need `wl-clipboard` in order to copy and paste.

### Login

Logging in works via the UI on first startup of the application.

If you are logging in with a bot token, you have to prepend `Bot ` (yes, with
the space) in front of the token. Pasting only works via your terminals normal
pasting shortcut.

**YOUR PASSWORD IS NEVER SAVED LOCALLY.**

If you need to find out how to retrieve your token, check [the wiki](https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/cordless/wiki/Retrieving-your-token).

**Currently captcha-code login isn't supported.**

## Quick overview - Navigation (switching between boxes / containers)

| Shortcut | Action |
| - |:- |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> | Sets the focus on the servers (guilds) container |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> | Sets the focus on the channels container |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> | Sets the focus on the messages container |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> | Sets the focus on the messages input field |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> | Sets the focus on the users container |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> | Opens the direct messages container |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> | Toggles the internal console view |

Further shortcuts / key-bindings can be found in the manual on the internal
console with the command `manual`.

If any of the default commands don't work for you, open the keyboard shortcut
changer via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>.

## Contributing

All kinds of contributions are welcome. Whether it's correcting typos, fixing
bugs, adding features or whatever else might be good for the project. If you

relevant to your planned pull request onto that branch. This will help
isolating new changes and make merging those into `master` easier.

If you encounter any issues, whether it's bugs or the lack of certain features,
