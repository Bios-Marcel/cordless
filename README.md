**WARNING: Third party clients are discouraged and against the Discord TOS.**

Cordless is a custom [Discord](https://discordapp.com) client that aims to
have a low memory footprint and be aimed at power-users.

The application only uses the official Discord API and doesn't send data to
third parties. However, this application is not an official product by
Discord Inc.

![Demo Screenshot](.github/images/chat-demo.png)

## Installation

### Building from source

In order to execute the following command, you need to install **go 1.13 or**
higher. You can find golang packages at (https://golang.org/doc/install).

**UPDATES HAVE TO BE INSTALLED MANUALLY**

Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your systems `PATH` variable, since the
binary will be put into that folder. Afterwards install or update cordless
via the command:

```shell
GO111MODULE=on; go get -u github.com/Bios-Marcel/cordless
```

The environment variable is necessary for correct compilation. In future go
versions this hopefully won't be necessary anymore. The syntax above will work
for both powershell, bash and probably a row of other shells. If it
doesn't work for your shell, please search the internet, using your
favourite search engine, for `how to set an environment variable in XXX`.

Note:

* X11 users need `xclip` in order to copy and paste.
* Wayland users need `wl-clipboard` in order to copy and paste.
* Mac OS users need `pngpaste` in order to copy and paste images.

### Installing on Linux

#### Snap

**Currently I can't release new snap versions due to a bug!**

Run (Might require sudo):

```shell
snap install cordless
```

Snap will automatically install updates.

#### Arch based Linux distributions

On Arch based distributions, you can use the AUR package to install cordless:

```shell
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/cordless-git.git
cd cordless-git
makepkg -sric
```

or use your favourite AUR helper.

### Installing on Windows

In order to install the latest version on Windows, you first need to install
[scoop](https://scoop.sh/#installs-in-seconds).

After installing scoop, run the following:

This adds the bucket (repository) that contains cordless to your local scoop
installation, allowing you to install any package it contains. Afterwards
it installs cordless for your current windows user.

```ps1
scoop bucket add biosmarcel https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/scoopbucket.git
scoop install cordless
```

Updates can be installed via:

```ps1
scoop update cordless
```

### Installing on macOS

Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install `cordless` on macOS:

```shell
brew tap Bios-Marcel/cordless
brew install cordless
```

If you don't install via cordless via brew, then you should have to get
`pngpaste` in order to be able to paste image data.

### Login

**YOUR PASSWORD IS NEVER SAVED LOCALLY.**

Logging in works via the UI on first startup of the application.

If you are logging in with a bot token, you have to prepend `Bot` in front of
the token.

If you need to find out how to retrieve your token, check [the wiki](https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/cordless/wiki/Retrieving-your-token).

**Currently captcha-code login isn't supported. Thanks for your SHIT-API, Google**

changer via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>.
