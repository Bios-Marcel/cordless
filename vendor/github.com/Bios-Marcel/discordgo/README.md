# Non-TOS compliant fork of Discordgo

This fork allows usage of normal discord accounts. The support sin't really
proper and API versions might differ from endpoint to endpoint.

Examples are probably out of date, but it's fine by me, this is mostly for
personal use. However, feel free to do with it what you will.
